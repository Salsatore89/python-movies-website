# Videos website

The videos website is a website that displays box art, title, youtube link and other data of a list of movies and tv shows, using python as language on the server side and html, css and javascript for the front end.

# Usage

To see it in action you just have to open the file named "movies_website.html" with your favorite web explorer. There is no need to install anything unless you want to edit some of the code. In that case you would need to open the .py extension files with Python (preferable with version **2.7.14**, as it was the version used to create them). 

### Dependencies

The _Videos website_ needs to import from the Python Standard Library **webbrowser**, **os**, and **re** modules. The html file makes use of Bootstrap for styling and jQuery for handling user events.

### Development

### Todos

 There are plenty of things to do:
 - Add more movies and Tv shows
 - Make a detail view for every movie and Tv show to display more data
 - Give user the ability to rate each movie/tv show
 - In the backend it would be great to move all the data to a database, instead of having it hardcoded in the "entertainment_center" file
